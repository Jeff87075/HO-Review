1. PMH A&E
It was my 1st rotation and I learnt a lot there. The seniors were very nice and supportive and allowed me to have a lot of independence and learning opportunities. On a normal working day, I would be either arranged to work at cubicle (Cat 3 cases) or walking clinic (Cat 4 & 5 cases). After some initial training, I was expected to see cases independently and ask for advice if I have any problem. All cases would need senior to countersign before they can be disposed, and for complicated cases seniors would look at the case again themselves. They also encouraged me to help out in R room where I could learn a lot of acute treatment/resuscitation for patients. There was only 2 days of EM ward duties where I was told to follow the seniors in rounds/round a couple of cases.
2.KWC FM
This was my 2nd rotation. I was arranged to have most of my time in one GOPC and sometimes in other clinics. The seniors were also very nice at the clinic I worked at. But due to the fact that all are independent consultations in separate rooms, they could not allow houseman to involve too much in medical consultations. They allowed me to see a few more stable patients with endorsements from MOs. I spent most of my time learning/participating in the other aspects of GOPC services including RAMP programmes, FM specialist clinics, allied health programmes, etc. I was a bit disappointed at first as I wished to learn more in medical consultations but then later I find the learning experience actually very rewarding and prepared me to be a better family physician by letting me  communicate with patients in a different setting and personally experience the different services of a GOPC.

Procedures done by community nurse outside (e.g. flushing drains) have to be done by you. So work in ward is highly unpleasant.

OPD: Yes you need to see OPD on your own! Some OPD are chur (e.g. cardiac). Can ask senior if in doubt. Going OPD means that your ward buddy will get busier...
Setting drip: if you didnt need to set drip in previous rotation this can be a challenging part. Some ward (e.g. A2, D6, E3) nurses will kindly help you set. For contrast scan, need 20G on upper limbs. For CTPA, need 18G on elbow.
Compulsory escort for CT scans: somehow starting in mid-March there is need for escorting contrast CT when there is no radiologist in CT suite
There is a thing called ""Ward follow up"" here. Basically it is a tool to enable early discharge. You will need to see discharged patients coming to the ward for e.g. trace blood results, private CT scan report, etc. These are seen by HO. If in doubt can ask MO (if they are here). This system is very troublesome and intern coordinators said they are going to change (but not sure when)
Starting in R3 they are extra cautious about ECG (since there is a case of missed STEMI in R2). Nurses are forced to chur HO to screen ECG more often...","Good if you wanna work in QMH MED. Not quite if you just want to have a simple medical rotation.
MO are friendly and nice. They will make urgent consult themselves (most of the time, especially junior MO) which I really appreciate! Feel free to ask them if in doubt.
Many clerical work and d/c summaries (quick turnover here)
Daytime duty busy (ward FU, OPD), call duty is relatively ok (just 2 wards)
Need to handle a lot of things in ward even you got 2-3 HO. Could be a tough start for those working in R1 (hope you have more HO).
I know people say that there is less call here. But somehow in R2, 3, 4 we got only around 18 HO so calls are not as less as you think.","You may make request to secretary before starting the rotation. I recommend working in male wards (A2, D6, E3). You will soon find that male nurses are more helpful. E3 and E6 interns need to cover specialty beds inside the wards as well (GI, oncology, haem, rheumat).
Nurses are good and will treat you night food.

Drip setting: Pretty much the only hospital that mandates HO to set all drips. Could be difficult and you get a lot of stick from patients but then you'll become drip god after 3 months here.
Compulsory admission: Also get to learn a lot about how to admit cases here as you'll be the only doctor seeing the patient at night in the first hour.
Phlebotomist: QMH blood gu tend to be mediocre, every now and then will leave difficult bloods to you; also will refuse to help you with beans basically
Urgent scans: have to personally go down there and R; gists among the most troublesome in all hospitals, E1 appointments ridiculously long so you'll get asked to go down and R scans on a daily basis - on the good side once you rotated here you'll sort of get the hang of Ring scans and you'll sort of learn what is really urgent and what is not (if a QMH gist doe accept then it must be very urgent)
No need print jobsheets: thank god.
Day centre: specialty HOs will get assigned to day centres and have to do ALL the clerical work there. Can't describe how much I hated those - >30 dc sums per day, loads of IPMOE premed and they will rush you again and again. Basically no need to use brain here and nth to learn at all (no procedures for you to do btw since you'll be too busy to come). A certain day centre in here (or shall I say night) is notorious for auditing every single bits of your char sums including typos, diagnostic coding so constantly there will be 3 stacks of dc sums for you to type as well as amend. They will also call you at 1pm for 6pm admissions.
OPDs: another thing special about here is that you'll be asked to see OPDs on your own. they will put u in the same room as the prof and u can ask whenever you want - my experience is that the prof will come and stop you whenever you're about to do sth stupid and it will all be ok - it's also kinda a refreshing experience away from all the shitty clerical ward work and you get to spend more time with patients and try and manage on your own","Overall QMH Med is quite educational. It is the only place that I've been to that actually try (or in another way, can afford to try) to train you to do MO things eg. independent OPD, case admission. Daytime quite busy and much more clerical work than others, and on call time less so. Limitations include (1) basically all the patients here are so stable so whenever shit hits the fan you would have called MO already so you don't know shit about learning lum cases (2) no procedures. Recommend if you aren't aiming medicine (can just shut down your brain most of the day) or if you have two med rotations (can learn all the other stuff in peripheral)","so many HOs in QMH so always can find meal buddies","M20",NA,NA,"MED QMH"

- UCH Med is probably the most famous for letting housemen do virtually all procedures. MOs very willing to teach in the first month as they want HO to take over the duties as soon as possible. Very good training opportunity for people who want to do med.
- If you take the initiative to follow rounds, the seniors will let you round a few cases yourself. But no pressure and the rounds are quite educational in general.
- All ward complaints are directed to HO, so you learn to assess patients comprehensively, document clearly, and most importantly to call for help whenever you feel uncomfortable. Nurses almost never direct call MOs (except arrest calls). During on call hours, if you need to ask for help you need to call higher trainees, but they are in general quite nice if you have all the information ready.

QEH MED:
- Chur but in a productive way (as in chur with acute medical problems, bloods, etc instead of clerical work like printing job sheets and typing discharge summaries)
- Frail patients + lots of HO independence because the MOs are so busy → you become good at independently managing acute medical problems very quickly (lots of shock, desaturation, severe electrolyte disturbances, arrests, etc) which will help for the rest of your HO rotations
- Exposure to a wide range of case types + severity of illness (patients tend to be quite sick)
- Downside of independence = lack of feedback on your management especially when on call unless you proactively seek it out
- Very friendly and smart MOs, some are very proactive teachers,  most are very willing to teach if you ask them questions
- No need to print job sheets, no compulsory admission, no need to type discharge summaries!! → more of your time is focused on ""medical"" things like dealing with ward complains, taking bloods, doing ward procedures, etc
- Wide range of procedures: BMAT, LP, pleural tap, abdominal tap, pleurodesis
- On the whole very competent nurses
- Need to do ECG on calls, Saturday PM, Sunday, PH which can be annoying but technically is more predictable time-wise than having to setting HB

QEH ICU:
- Extremely nice and friendly seniors who are knowledgable and willing to teach
- Follow rounds, round cases, see consultations, do procedures (set central lines, A-lines, etc; QEH ICU lets HO do a lot more lines than other ICUs), type discharge summaries / night summaries, do usual homework (T&S, book scans, consultations, etc
- Mix of intensivists from medicine (CCM) and anaesthesia (ICM) backgrounds → exposure to both streams
- Morning handover starts at 08.30, afternoon handover ends 17:00
- Call once per week, no need to stay overnight (usually leave after night round)
- Can focus more on learning as opposed to ""HO work"" because the ICU technically does not need a HO (ICU MOs usually do HO work like cultures, T&S, booking scans, etc); in a similar vein you need to be more proactive at finding things to do since relatively little work is ""assigned"" to you compared to other rotations",NA,"M20",NA,NA,"MED-ICU QEH"

1) can leave on time at 5pm strict every day as daytime duties aren't that heavy (make sure to ask other HOs to help out as the workload is very uneven among different wards esp 11/F during covid times)
2) almost ward complaints are dealt by MOs unless D jor (including all critical labs)
3) 3 HOs on call during weekends which is very nice compared to 2 during the weekdays
4) call rooms available in each ward so u have a proper bed to sleep (not necessarily during covid times)
5) admissions aren't compulsory

Cons:
1) low educational value, did not use my brain for 3 months
2) no procedures to do
3) phlebotomists cannot draw blood / set IVs anywhere other than ULs so u get these stupid 'difficult bloods / beans' all the freakin time; annoying AF, do NOT give in too easily lol
4) workload during on-calls are quite heavy as one HO handles 10 wards (up to 14 during our covid times wtf w/ 30-60 pt per ward); nurses will ask for your CMS code and all of us eventually gave our PW to them so they can help print job sheets (otherwise u won't be able sleep at all)
5****) UNREASONBLE ABGs; threshold for ABGs are low; multiple room air - 2LO2 ABGs during the night, not to mention chest pain ABG wtf...culture for ABGs here is just straight up BAD

Regarding certain ppl:
- secretary Vivian needs help, she has emotional problems and is very annoying so be careful when u negotiate with her
- MO Sam Tsoi is super nice to HOs, treats dinner and draws ABGs himself sometimes
- MO Chris Lau treats dinner every time

In rotation 3 (COVID wave), I am too tired to follow rounds in the morning. You need to be very determined and keen in order to follow am rounds since you would be really tired with the 3-day-1-call schedule.

Atmosphere & Learning:
- Atmosphere quite good actually. Not hostile at all.
- MOs and seniors are really friendly and willing to teach.
- No pressure if you phone them for help during calls. 99% of them are patient and willing to help you without scolding you.
- Intern coordinator is nice but too weak to fight for more resources e.g. more manpower.
- Quite a lot of tutorials (10-12), which are quite useful.
- If you are keen to follow rounds, you can probably learn more.

Workload:
- really A LOT, be it daytime/ during call.
- We had 11 houseman in rotation. In our year some rotations had 10 HOs, some had 11 HOs.
- Tbh, TMH Medical needs at least 14 HOs to be a more humane one.
- Back in 2017 there could be 14 HOs in TMH Med. But no longer this case now lah...

Nurses: Vary a lot. Some are competent while some are on9, esp in rehab blocks 

Hw wise already very houseman friendly:
No need to:
- print most job sheet
- set HB, take blood culture 
- make urgent consults
- admit cases
- type dc sum
- R scan
(For urgent scans, you can just book on CMS then call Radi dept and tell them which MO is in charge of the case) 

- for XR requests it is still quite vague. Sometimes in some acute wards nurses can / are willing to request for you; some dont. Also because some wards are not medical wards eg paedi wards hv overflow cases so they just ask you to do lol 

Basically houseman hw include:
- clerical work
- blood taking for type& screen and ABGs
- escort cases ie. intubated/on NIV cases; CT contrast (during non office hours only)
- handle ward complaints
- screen XRs and CTB

Need to force time for lunch once you see there's no urgent hw. Med have HO room, but med HO rarely / never lunch together because everyone is so busy and lunch time is not guaranteed. 
Call: For main block call sleep is luxury. Maybe I'm slow but many of time if I want to get like 30 mins - 1h of sleep I can provided I ignore some labs / X ray reports / non-urgent ward complaints. For busy calls I don't sleep and still cannot finish hw so daytime HO have to do it (this stops happening after a few weeks, but leftover labs / X rays still happens). Having other HO finish <=5pm hw of their wards is very very helpful. Rehab block can sleep 2-4 hours if not black, but daytime is chur since you cover like 11 wards. Many times I non stop work till 12am then get to sleep (+/- lunch &/or dinner when I can find some free time).

This place is chur dou nuclear explosion, first few weeks every day really want to cry / quit (did cry), HO rarely see each other since everyone's busy. On call it's not lone call, but HO will not see each other too (1 is upper floors, 1 is lower floors, 1 is rehab block), everyone is non stop working. I recall often finally able to have dinner at 2-3am after finishing most urgent hw in main block, then going to 7-11 to buy microwave heated meals to eat in HO room (~15 mins), then going back to ward to continue clearing hw. I have no idea how I survived, but know that we all do somehow survive (with different degrees of PTSD I guess). If you set your expectations low, expect non-stop work / direct calls during daytime or on call, then the rotation will be less of a shock to you. While everyday we are all drowning and struggling to keep ourselves alive, try to help someone out when you are less busy (rarely happens) and you see them struggling (eg covering 2 other HO's duty). I remember someone coming to help with my pm duty when I had to cover 2 ppl, and I really cannot express how grateful I am. I think we are all low / high key depressed during the rotation tbh.

TMh is one of the most chur MED places, but I think it's not the worst. TMH med have some malignant MOs but most are okay, nurse quality is not the worst really. Once you get used to the types of homework, life becomes slightly easier and you'll get slightly more sleep. Remember to treat yourself, I took taxi to bus stop just to save 10 minutes so I can arrive home slightly earlier. I had hostel but only slept there during rehab block calls, because I would go crazy if I don't go home and get support from my family. Try to exercise if you can. 

If you have the passion / energy, then can learn in the morning rounds. I did not and my tutors were understanding, so I mostly just watched them round and learnt frmo that.

The working environment is extremely hostile.

Often blame HO for not admitting cases during on call hours which indeed the duties for on call HO already have a lot, ABG rounds starting from 0500 for >20 ABGs, all CT brains (ard 1x every night) viewing, all ward complaints, and sometimes even need to help MO to do procedures at midnight (i.e. 0200 for a diagnostic pleural tap).

","Do you like getting stepped on, thrown into lava to struggle yourself or told its okay to get omicron on duty because you probably wont die? If the answer is yes then UCH medical is the perfect place for you! Nearly all of us put UCH med as 1st choice but it was the biggest mistake we made this year. So much has happened, especially with the worst COVID wave, that it is impossible to cover even half of the shit we had to eat. Here are some Hor d'oeuvres if you are actually considering this cesspit. 

You might have heard UCH lets you do lots of procedures, but did you know your first time doing bone marrow exam might be supervised by a fellow intern since the MO is “busy”. Or you might be tasked to do LP on call at night alone or on a surgery patient, supervised only by God. The lack of MO support is also pervasive on call. Despite assessing the patient and providing management, some MO will still challenge your competency and demand to know why you called them. MO verbal order cardioversion? HO自己搞啦. Massive GI bleed with huge Hb drop and unstable vitals? HO自己搞啦. Urgent consulted NS and NS MO wants to discuss with UCH med MO? HO自己搞啦. Nurse also makes problem worse because a lot claim they cannot call MO, ""clinical communication must be done between Drs"", even when patient about to arrest and there is no DNACPR. But not calling on call MO is also a sin, if case MO doesn't like your mx next morning, you will be interrogated :)

COVID also killed ro 3 very hard, when omicron just started, one intern coordinator told us he wasn't concerned we would get omicron as ""我哋唔驚還唔返個仔俾阿媽"". Despite asking for deployment right in the beginning, we lasted the whole wave without having any deployment, even when 4/10 interns were in quarantine. Only 3 interns were on duty one dismal afternoon and there were 3 consecutive days with only one intern on call, with most of UCH wards converted to medical. All the coordinators have to say is ""your hardship is well noted"" and deployment ""may take sometime as our cos is very busy"". 

It's normal for nurses to bully HO, but definitely abnormal for the whole department to do so. We have warned you, UCH medical is not a good place for your training or mental health.

There are some MOs who are particularly not helpful: There's literally one time I told one MO (aka HCChow) ""can I ask you something"" and he literally replied me with ""but I don't want to answer you"" even before my question...
CMO don't care about their patients anymore after like morning rounds because it is technically not their duty time but the stay ward's so they refuse to help and ask you to find stay ward instead.
UC med actually mentally and physically exploited us. MOs do not appreciate you at all (except the ones rotate from HHH they are nice), but take everything for granted, order 6am ABG for no reason when the patient uses the same mode of bipap every single day.

You are hired as HO but you are treated worse than the cleaner in this hospital. Do NOT expect you have basic workers right. You have to do everyone’s job even moving patient’s bed. Intern coordinators will definitely listen to your opinions and tell you “life is not fair, suck it up!” right in your face. 
You should expect the worst of the worst here in order to make yourself feel better and get through this rotation. 
Regular verbal abuse from MOs during on calls is what you get in return. When you call them for expertise advice, you get blamed for no reasons; or maybe because you disturb their precious sleep (although they have protected sleep time already). You have to throw away your self-respect to work in UCH in order to provide care for patients. You have to beg for MOs to come. (Don’t ask me why.)
Some MOs refuse to first attend the desaturated (from Room air to 100%) patients without assessment of HOs despite HO’s engagement in escort or arrest calls. Nurses refuse to call MOs for absolute urgency and insist to call HO first although 5MOs are on call each night. Nurses will call you for everything with direct calls q1min, ranging from insomnia to arrest call. Even when you explain you are having arrest call, they will just yell out HO rmb xx ward bed xx needs D50! 

Multiple HOs are told to do night procedures ordered by MO at 12:00am without MO’s guidance. MOs order ABG for every desaturated patient and COPD patient so you will be an expert at ABG from day 1 (not to mention the ABG round on your first day call with a baseline of 10).

In short, this hospital has poor management and the most hostile environment compared to the previous 2 rotations I have had.

MOs will not support you. There are a few horrible MOs who will blame you for calling them from their sweet dreams (although they have protected sleep time) even when the patient is in critical condition aka going into arrest. They frequently call back to YELL at HOs. Well, they do not have the sense of case MO in this place. They can just ignore the patients when they finish their rounds. If you call them for their expertise opinions, they will throw around words like “If you already know what to do, why did you even tell me?” Or “How do you survive when you cannot even deal with these problems?” Or “Don’t you know who I am?” 
They will also order night procedures which are very dangerous with no indication at all. For example 12am lumbar puncture when the patient had no fever and no CTB or 12am pleural tapping when the patient clearly needed a chest drain (but chest drain is done by MOs whereas pleural tap is done by HOs) - MO even said later saying the patient would need another pleural tap the next day (and another HO did the pleural tap). They clearly have no respect to patients’ life. We all decide never send our family to this hospital after this rotation. 
MOs even ask HOs to attend medical consultation work from other specialties. There is no other explanation to such behaviour besides laziness and being irresponsible. 
You will have to do nurses’ jobs and porters’ job too. You will know how to inject dilantin q8h and push beds around. 
Intern coordinators are the worst. When you ask for equalising the workload (HO1: 1 ward and HO2: all other wards), his reply is “Life is not fair. I do not think this is a problem.” And in the end, some HOs will have 14 times of HO1 and 5times of HO2 and the other way round. It is mentally stressful and exhausting working in a environment where HOs are treated like dogs and you feel hopeless. They refused to support HOs since February- they refused HOs deployment from other specialties whwreas they deployed MOs from other specialties to medical to help out. There was one day when only 3 HOs working in the afternoon because half of the HOs were on quarantine in the mid of March. They even forced various HOs to lone call-there were at least 6days! How can one HO manage the whole department? This is mentally and physically traumatising! We do not even have basic worker’s right! It is putting patients’ life at risk too!

Overall a good rotation if compared to ALL specialties of all hospitals

Again, phleb support is A++++++++

Most day time hw are mo liu stuff tho, like 補寫CMK, copy MAR to a new one, CMK ""For Dr XXX: xxxx"" etc
Renal ward N4 has a particular problem that they need you to print hundreds of covid jobsheet for dialysis pts when the system only allows you to print one by one, so you become a lifeless clicking machine for super long
Most MOs are nice, there's a fat one who likes to spread rumours and backstab you tho but apparently he rotated away already
Do look out for another fat female MO tho
In this rotation, do NOT tell MOs/ seniors your offers (or you can create smoke bombs yourselves ge, throw them bunch of fake news and let them be confused) otherwise may have unpredicted consequences
Another great thing here: flexibility, allows verbal order for many common orders like D50, resonium, K syrup, actrapid and can write back next day
There are technically 2 days per month which u need go OPD to see cases, but you can choose not to go and USUALLY they wont summon you (there was occasions that HO was summoned tho)
Also not really compulsory to sign labs

Bad things:
- some MO and seniors will over complain about you not admitting cases, basically dont understand there is fundamental difference in job nature of HO and MO
- intern coordinator not helpful, condemned us for admitting too few cases mid-rotation, just ask you to ""er, more hardworking lor, 要做既野都係要做架啦, 人地做到你地都做到"", it's like they forget MO admitting cases wont magically let the patients receive drugs (we fking copied the MAR for you which takes super long man)","M21",NA,4,"MED KWH"

Yet, no matter how terrifying our feedback are, a certain number of you will eventually be assigned to UCH med anyways. It definitely will be extremely depressing and traumatizing, but please at least get mentally prepared after reading our comments, and dont have unrealistic expectation/ false hope like we did :)

<Workload>
Daytime workload can sometimes be barely manageable. As a medical department, the official working hour of 0830-1800 is relatively demanding. And it is not uncommon to off at 8/9pm at the beginning of the rotation. I actually skipped lunch and pee time for leaving work punctually for the first time. 

To be fair, the physician assistants here do help us with a large part of clerical work, and phlebotomists support is good. But the workload is still tremendous. We all came and wanted to learn bedside procedures, but turned out being so fed up with it. MOs love to order procedures because unlike other hospitals, its HO's job here instead of MO's responsibility. They clearly knew that you have 3 LP + 2 chest tap + 1 skin biopsy for that morning because apparently they ordered all of them, but they would never help. Even during on call, LP at 12am/ chest tap at 4am/ LP for a surgical patient who consulted med are common shits that we had to bear with. I mean, you can learn all sorts of procedures in different hospitals out there, dont come for those unreasonably unlimited procedures here. 

On call is extremely tough. The workload allocation of having one HO doing compulsory admission and one HO handling all the ward complaints from 14 wards is simply on99. 講真十幾個wards喎大佬，我成晚聽電話都聽唔切仲點處理ward complaints. 10-20 6am abg is daily routine that only exists in UCH med, which i dont really understand why only KEC patients require these many abg. 

唔好以為愈忙愈多野學, you can never trace back the patient you managed during on call because the list is just too long. You will never know whether you gave the right treatment or not, unless CMO called you back the other day to yell at you about a case of mild PRB with stable vitals, challenging your Ix order of cbc and clotting are ""好無聊"", but not telling you what he wanted you to do with this case at 6am in the morning.

<Seniors>
Yes the workload is worse; but the worst part here is the hostile working environment with shitty inhumane seniors. 

We, as naive newbies at the beginning of the rotation, had tried to seek help and reflect to intern coordinator aka Edward that it was unreasonable for one on call HO to handle all the wards. And even if we gave up admission with both HOs doing ward work, it was not very manageable either. Eventually, we got blamed for not doing admission. Edward forced the nurses to repeatedly call us for admission, banned MO from admitting cases before we did, and posted the number of case admission every HO did in whatsapp group daily. 

All he did was to type ""we are here to help you"" in whatsapp group 真係好嘔心. 滿口孔孟仁義道德但一手推我地埋牆角真係虛偽到不得了

In the end of course they have never addressed the problem of heavy workload/ uneven work distribution during on call. Till now i really cannot imagine how desperate rot3 colleagues were to bear with the extra workload/ lone call during covid. 

CUHK graduation ceremony is usually on a weekday in Nov. UCH med intern coordinator decided to let us leave work from UCH 1.5hr before start of graduation ceremony, and require all CUHK HO to go back to work at 7pm after graduation ceremony; while other HOs in other hospitals can have a legit one-day off. Actually i still havnt figured out is this even legal to have us all going back to work at 7pm. 

UCH med is literally the worst shithole. I have been counting down since day1 and I truly believe that no one deserves to experience even 1% of these struggles. If you are assigned to have UCH med, all i could say is good luck. Try to bear the pain together with your colleagues in K6.

Believe me you have only very few days of day duty and day duty feels like being on call. 
I developed on call depression every time I need to be on call as the duty workload is sheer overwhelming, especially during covid times, where isolation wards are opening like 7-11. 
We have three HO on call everyday, HO1 and 2 are acute call, HO3 is rehab call which is much more chill. 
DO NOT expect you can sleep on call, or else you would break down every time you are on call. Expect maybe 30 minutes of sleep every time, and nurses call you for very ong9 things like K3.2, Na 129, Hb 7.1 (baseline 7), cannot insert foley, H'stix 15-25 during night time. I once received a call telling me the patient is wandering around the ward, and what am I supposed to do?

What I learned in TMH:
1. Extremely high HO independence, every ward complaint is handled by you. Rarely anyone will directly call MO before or after calling you, you need to manage all by yourself, and decide whether to call MO yourself. MO rarely comes to attend the patient as they have very heavy workload as well. 
I have dealt with NSTEMI multiple times, starting Clexane+aspirin+plavix by myself then telling MO afterwards. The lab results here are also very astonishing, TropI >50000, K>10.0, Na 103, Hb 3.6. It is so crazy around here. 
The ward complains here are also 世界級. Multiple drop BP per night, tachycardia up to 200 (need cardio version), septic shock (need to start phenylephrine infusion by yourself). One night I've started three dopamine infusion as well. But MO are always helpful in dealing with ward complains if you feel incompetent in anyway and seldom feedback from seniors. 
But remember do not tropI/CK Q4H till peak, this is the only feedback from the whole rotation to our batch.

2. There are many HO lessons during weekdays, but I seldom attend as most of the days I'm post call, but I've heard they are quite useful. 

3. Good colleagues are definitely important, as we need to cross cover duties during post call half and also when someone is on leave. So doing HW together helps out the on call person a lot and help the day duty people to leave on time. Once we worked together, things are like clockwork and shit went much smoother. 

4. You will question your purpose in life, as you reach >9 calls per month, your life consist only of pre-call, call and post-call, there is limited time to rest your mind, let alone physically. it is so inhumane in TMH, should at least need >2 HO to deal with this shit. 

For me in particular, being on call on 1/1 is the worse as we do not have anyone to cover day duty, and need to deal with the shit people left us last night. I took >25 ABG and >15 T&S that call. I don't want to do that ever again.",NA,"M21",NA,4,"MED TMH"

You can avoid A LOT of paperwork (no need job sheet, no need DC sum) and have quite a lot of chances for procedure (with adequate guidance). Moreover you won’t get the pressure of getting feedback too often. And MOs generally feedback in a nice manner and only when it’s really necessary. Have a lot of freedom in terms of management (as long as you don’t do harm to the patient), whereas you might get a lot of feedback/stress in medical elsewhere.

Most important, have post call half. And you can choose to follow OPD to learn post call if you want to do Med (if you don’t then feel free to skip, they understand you’re tired post call)

Every houseman gets his or her own tutor who is willing to teach and guide you. You can follow round or ask them to guide you do procedure if they’re free (or if the CMO is too busy to guide you for the first few times)

Have a lot of procedures, especially the HO working in day ward. So no need to worry about having no chance to do procedure. And usually MO will do those difficult ones themselves so no need to worry having to perform risky procedures.

Day work: clear morning round hw. Draw bloods. R scan. After getting used to the pace day work is actually very acceptable.

Weekend: a bit tougher. Will get busy. 5 HO per day. Some lines are less chur than others so please help colleagues in chur line.

Call: need to look after 6-7 wards ( but real big wards 2-3 only, others are small wards or fake day wards ). Nurses are VERY COMPETENT AND SUPER NICR! (Most of them are) they won’t call you for stupid things, and you don’t have much new admission homework as just need blood taking/ECG/start and resume meds. As most MOs have been QE houseman, most of them won’t order too many ECGs or bloods at night unless really necessary (ofc there’re always exceptions lol). So can actually sleep more than you think (ofc depend on whiteness). And if you’re very busy can always ask fds from other lines to offer some help. 

AND HAVE POST CALL HALFFF!

Nurses and wards: probably the best ever you can get. Won’t call stupid things. Will be polite when calling you. Will avoid calling you during late night on call (unless real stuff) competent, usually can give you answer if you have anything you don’t know. Also very trustworthy. (Some ward may even help you do ECG during on call!!)
(Btw only direct calls in QE, but no message system)

Educational value: have HO tutorials. Also with team meeting weekly sharing interesting cases or topics. Combined with the procedures. And can help admit cases, MO willing to teach you how to admit if they see you help. (But won’t force you to admit so no pressure. And they’ll be grateful if you help)

1) rotation is divided in half so O & G for 1.5 months respectively; can leave at 5pm SHARP every day for obs rotation so it's a very good period for rehab; not to mention the amount of free time for pcc breaks during the day loll gyn is much more stressful though

Cons:
1) general gynae has the worst working hours; HOs are really expected to round before MO so u arrive at 7ish every day but since PM rounds can be as late as 6pm as they hv OTs, u might have to leave at 7pm
2) u are literally needed in the OTs as they don't have enough ppl so u are bound to be involved in assisting emergency Caesars 
3) nurses in gynae are stupid as they are so not used to dealing with real medical emergencies; they freak out when K is 5.2 and call u frequently for non-urgent tasks 
4) literally ALL female nurses / midwives and not a single 阿sir so u can imagine how annoying bitches can be esp when they gossip
5) atmosphere in general gyn is stressful; seniors like to be harsh and unfriendly esp to junior MOs; don't say stupid things esp if you're uncertain; having a Y chromosome helps immensely

They lie and spread rumours and mistreat patients. They only sit at the nursing stations and gossip or do online shopping. They ignore urgent needs from patient occasionally because they are lazy. But no worries, because they treat female nursing students like slaves which makes you feel slightly better if you were born a female. 
Intern coordinator is very nice and knows about their behaviours but he cannot do anything about it as well. It is very uncomfortable working with these horrible nurses and clerks in C5. I have never seen nurses with such disrespectful unprofessional behaviours.

- Quite incompetent nurses in certain wards who might not be able to make the best clinical judgement

I am interested to go inside Ortho OT in the afternoon, but simply dont have time for that. 
Rotation 1 people usually go to OT USING THEIR OWN POST CALL OFF.

If you dont like Ortho and want to chill, DONT CHOOSE HERE. 
THIS IS NOT A REHAB ROTATION AT ALL.

Atmosphere & Learning:
- MOs and seniors are generally friendly and willing to teach.
- I respect intern coordinator Dr. Kwun a lot. He is a good boss that respects HOs.
- There are some tutorials which are okay.

Workload:
- NOT REHAB FOR ORTHO
- 4 acute wards + 3 rehab wards. 
- Only 5 houseman. (daytime pm could have only 2 houseman left)
- Every morning type ~20 dc sums / ward.
- Afternoon workload is not chill either. 

Nurses:
- generally okay.

Schedules & Calls:
- usually 3-4 day 1 call.
- can be tiring too because daytime workload is not as rehab as other ortho rotations.
- Need to work really hard in a post call morning in order to clear all AM round homework before 1pm (so you could leave on time)
- MO would appreciate if you help them admit cases but not compulsory anyways.

No houseman room was really bad. We jammed medical HO room on 1/F but you really need to make friends with medical HO before using their room.

Need to call other specialties for urgent consults.","I had a happy rotation just because I made good friends with the other 4 housemen. Work satiafaction was not high tbh.

If you can handle both OT/OPD and ward duties, then it's good for you!","This is my worst rotation among all four. Some of my rotations in larger hospitals in MED/SURG that are supposedly more chur are still better than TKOH ORT. I might be biased, but here's what I try to list out the pros and cons in this rotation.

Pros:
(1) TKOH ORT is a pseudo-acute department. Workload is not really heavy tbh.
(2) Standard of patient care here is not very high (compare to places like teaching hospital PWH/QMH), so actually you are free to order whatever Ix/Mx you want. They just can't judge you. 
(3) MOs can be friendly if your vibe matches with them
(4) Not too bad to pass by in rotation 3/4.

Cons:
(1) Zero educational value. Since TKOH is a pseudo-acute hospital with limited facility/support, there's not much trauma call/ trauma cases. Mainly minor injuries and fractures here. If you are keen on O&T, don't choose here, because there's only ""O"" and no ""T"" here. The latest protocol of TKOH A&E is meaning to send the real trauma patients to QEH (they say this is ""for the sake of patient care"", so you can guess the quality of patient care in TKOH ORT).
(2) Low support from irresponsible (and incompetent) MO. MOs here only deal with the bones, and you will be their in-house MED HO. But no one will teach you or provide feedback for how good/bad you handle the ward complaints. Worse thing is that sometimes you cant contact the 1st call MO during midnight (neither can the nurse) because 1st call is sleeping. Their usual practice is to ignore everything during midnight, and start to admit all midnight cases since 6am (since ORT nth urgent really). So if there's really sinister issue happening, you may find that you can't contact your 1st call MO. Then you'll have to urgent consult SURG/MED 1st call by yourself. You will know which MO(s) are irresponsible when you work here. Exception is that when your 1st call on that night is FM/SURG MO rotating here :) They are more responsible than this dept's own MO.
(3) Hostile nurses. Seems I don't have to tell more since other people have feedback on such. Totally agree with them. They are the most stupid + most hostile nurses that I encountered if I look back on my all 4 rotations. 散水餅送嘉頓雜餅都俾多班MK仔阿Sir同八婆nurse.
(4) Twisting of facts. This department likes to 老屈 HO! >< For example, if nurses failed to call a HO who is on AL, when they finally can call the on-call HO after 5pm, the on-call HO would become the one to be blamed on not replying to calls. WTF. Another example: when 穿窿call (i.e. no HO on call on that day), 1st call MO will blame the post-call HO (i.e. on-call on previous day) for not doing hw for 1st call (e.g. lazy, irresponsible, inefficient, not keen, etc. Whatever terms can appear to blame you). WTF?! Why can't the HO leave after finishing the on-call hours. Expect us to be on-call for two consecutive days?! Worse thing is that they will spread the news to the whole department, and their dumb seniors will not investigate on what has happened and just come to diu9 you. If they had looked in to the matter closely, they should know that it's 穿窿call on that day (without any HO), and so the 1st call MO is actually responsible for all HO duties. The post-call HO has right to leave after finishing the hours and the duties-on-hand.
(5) Passively aggressive seniors will have hidden demands on HO. So it's not as rehab as it should be, given the patient amount is light. Hidden demands include but not exclusive to: admit most E cases (they will even count your 收症%), morning rounds, grand rounds, OT, OPD, etc. Adding these miscellaneous burden to the routine HO duties = can be more tiring than a Surgery rotation in a big hospital.
(6) Bad hostel. Small room, bunk bed, need share room with another HO unless you are lucky to have no one else living in the hostel (therefore no roommate).
(7) Administrative rigidity and formality in taking leaves. Otherwise will diu9 you.
(8) Limited opportunities for HO to seek job at TKOH ORT because of limited vacancy in this small dept, max 1 post.",NA,"M21",NA,1,"ORT TKOH"

One word: EXCELLENT

Educational value: this maybe arguably the only ""downside"" of TKOH paedi.
There is only 1 gen ward here so case variety is definitely less than major centres.
You will not see 0-day old babies here, also there wont be any extreme preterm, intubated babies, A-line, end-of-life kind of stuff here
Therefore the exposure is indeed narrower than other major centres like PMH
On the other side if you wanna do paedi, there will be lots of time for you to revise, also they give good tutorials
Moreover, as the case load here is low, the morning rounds have the luxury for having extensive discussions on the management and teachings of book stuff
COS is actually a super knowledgeable neonatologist btw","Yes, this place really is the HO heaven just as others have described it
I got it as my 1st rotation, and there is not a single day in my rot 2 3 4 that I have not 回想 my days there.
I am not gonna write on how little the workload is (because others have already covered it multiple times), let's just say ""HO fighting for hw"" is actually true haha

Even if we take away the consideration of workload, this place is still fking awesome.
TKOH Paediatrics is a small department, it only has 1 ward (4B)
Doctors would be rotated between OPD team and ward team 
Starting with the MO & seniors, they are ALL very nice. The environment and vibe there is just like a small family, everyone knows each other well and the overall atmosphere is very positive. They are willing to teach, and would not blame you at all for asking for help.
You will also have a lot of chances to hang with the MOs esp during on call when you would usually order deliveroo tgt. 
I believe that the excellent atmosphere there is closely related to the personality of COS. A very friendly gentleman, absolutely no 架子, willing to teach, and 親力親為
The first thing he told us pre-interns, was to treat our own HO in the future nicely as they will rmb your kindness for life. 
How often would you see a COS actually counselling parents, give small group tutorials, spend time to know your ambitions and give you advices, come over to your OPD room to help you take difficult blood, stay behind till way past office hour to advise on a complicated case management, cook vegetables and fish in office pantry?
(Sidenote: he supports Liverpool FC)
MOs are all also very nice, esp one male MO (you will know who), on call with him is just joyful.
During daytime you dont need to R scans/ do ward complaints (theres none)/ escort
Every morning you need to send one HO to OPD around 10ish to take blood, ranging from 1-10 cases (avg 3-4)
Paedi blds may be hard to take initially, but as you pick up the skills, these sessions are actually great because it allows you to be alone in a quiet room and is actually relaxing.

Others:
- compulsory adm kinda yes becoz otherwise nth to do and they do expect you to admit
- NAI case admissions can be very long but MO will be present
- call room: you can choose the ""tea room"" which is 30 secs walking distance from ward and is very large, have CMS computer; or you can sleep at ACB 7/F which is darker and have comfortable pillows
- can shower and play music, super luxury and relaxing
- allows you to use the ""blue needle"" or HB to take blood, and heel prick for serum bili only (as opposed to PMH paedi uses heel prick for everything and is super exhausting I heard)
- have 24-hr 7-11
- Saturday call gives you compensatory leave is just ridiculously good

If you get TKOH Paedi in any of your rotations, please sit back, relax, and enjoy, and try to hold back your tears when you walk out of that door for one last time on your last day.

Hence good for rotation 1 and 2 if you want to learn surgery. The workload is manageable here hence you could spare time to admit cases, pre-round/ follow rounds, go inside OT etc. 

If you dont like surgery and want to chill, I guess it is also not bad for rotation 3-4 because you have post call half day off.

Atmosphere & Learning:
- MOs and seniors are generally friendly and willing to teach.
- Our intern coodinators changed a few times but generally all ACs are nice. Grades are good too!
- A few tutorials by ACs which were quite useful.
- If you are keen and live in hostel, you can go inside OT and observe EOT after work (provided that you know the MOs and ask them beforehand)

Workload:
- Workload is basically team based, because you stick to the same team for 3 months. Different team cases scatter in different wards. Team A (lower GI) has heavier workload, other teams e.g. Team B (UGI), C (HBP + breast), Urology have similar workload. 
- In total there are 3.5 wards (0.5 because share 1 ward with orthopedics), with 6 houseman in total. In my rotation we had 7 houseman so it was even better.
- Overall, workload is still quite manageable if houseman in different teams can cooperate well. 

Nurses:
- Some complained that nurses are not competent but I actually made rather good relationships with them during my first rotation (probably because I was still quite green back then). That said, nurses do not 跟檔 usually so I collect the stuff myself when I need to do bedside procedures.
- Dayward nurses can call you for moliu stuff e.g. print DTS jobsheet for them.

Schedules & Calls:
- Weekends: allow houseman to arrange weekend morning duties among ourselves (got 1-2 extra pair of hands to help the houseman on call during weekends)
--> good flexibility
- Calls workload could be tough, depends on your luck.

- Short call system:
--> we ""abolished"" the short call system so we only had long calls.","Highly recommended for those who like surgery!

3. Phlebotomist here will refuse take blood, :D, but they wont share their salary with you 
they are something you cant feel their existance 
4. Nurses here will have hundreds of stupid calls, you will have 80+ phone calls per call, 90% of then are stupids, e.g. call you to print jobsheet for Occupational therapy for MoCA assessment at 3am midnight :DDDDD 
5. 電話騙案，半夜流流call你講一大扎9唔搭8 最後可唔可以順手幫我打粒 hep block :D, 
6. without OT week you wont have chance to enter OT, almost no chance

3. HO quarter though quite old, but very big, and clean, and Jeh Jeh here are world class providing hotel level service :D 
4. OT week very happy

however being HO here is extremely boring and mindfucking and tiring, with VERY LOW sense of satisfactory / achievement

For Rotation 3-4, if you arrange work duty into ward-base, the workload should be much better 
if you work as team base as arranged by the department, it's quite a desaster 

As MO: 
- few lone calls, mostly double call, 
- 2nd call are benign and supportive 
- 6 calls per month, 

So, if you wanna work here as MO, suck it up for the HO period
otherwise, dont work as HO here.

One of the fewer places with surg OPD duties. But HBP OPD is no joke make sure you eat beforehand because as a HO you’d see some 30 cases in one session","I think it really depends on whether you are a “QMH person”, whether you enjoy the stressful environment of having to report to seniors who are sometimes hostile + find faults in the smallest thing + have a culture that involves blaming people (cf aggressions at m&m meetings); and hence practice defensive medicine + tend to overinvestigate.

If you are keen there are opportunities for research and presentations; they say QMH BSTs are better skilled at presentations than surgeries. Hours are long as expected in surgery but whether or not you vibe with the team / colleagues + see meaning in the long hours + endless presentations at team meetings/grand rounds determine how enjoyable the rotation will be. 
It is also one of the fewer centre that offer NS and Paedisurg for HOs. Compared to other places QMH surg is very subspecialised, only EGI does OGD, only CRS does lower endoscopies routinely. Perhaps as such they have more complexed OTs that you don’t really see at other places, eg vascular, LT and HBP.

Daytime workload is manageable unless you happen to work alone in H4
Compulsory hit bean is a fking problem
E call can be very busy during on-call, easily have 30+ admissions; lots of hw even if you admit 0 cases
W call is better, can sleep like 4-5 hrs
Uro HO slightly more busy
E call have post call half day

Post-covid:
QEH SUR became rehab, admit a few cases per night only
E call was cancelled (altho nurses still call u for adm), and only 2 ppl on call per night
Bean duty was later removed
Only need to work 3-4 hrs per day, can have daily lunch tgt + bbt round + card games

Most MOs are very nice esp junior ones
There is ONE malignant male MO who would just let new cases hang there, not admit them, but 催 you when u doing the admission; he has 2 E calls per month
He is racist towards CUHK ppl

Expect you to appear in round. 
Usually can clear AM round hw at around 10-11. No need to r urgent scan. No need to urgent consult (to be done by MO) so basically you need to print job sheet, take bloods, type dc sum. Sometimes day centre will call you to do a some suture and print job sheet

Need to help admit cases. But if you're 3rd or 4th, MO will understand that you don't help admit cases.

HAVE POST-CALL HALF DAY. RELATIVELY FEWER CALLS in surgery. So if you're lucky you can somehow rehab (i.e., in team B/C/U) The seniors are generally ok and supportive. 

Nurses are somehow malignant, especially for female wards. Call you impolitely. Other wards are actually reasonable. But will call you for stupid stuff at night, e.g., call you fever then after you workup, call you again for the same fever and tell you the body temperature decreases for 0.2 C, then ask you anything to do.

Good:
- HO quarter single room, quite spacious, supported by very nice jehjeh (although someone reported seeing mickeys...)
- They hired some clerks for printing jobsheets during office hour. They can request bloods/PT/OT/dietitian, which helps a bit...

Bad:
- NURSES! Throughout my rotation I have only met maybe 1-2 nurses who are competent and nice. 80% of them are incompetent and have poor attitude to HO. They call you for everything, including non-urgent investigations, routine consults, PT/OT, and abnormal blood results like K 3.2. They do not acknowledge the fact that each HO can have 3-4 wards to take care of in the afternoon and they only think their cubicle is urgent and want you to attend immediately. Even when there are multiple things to inform from the same ward, they do not coordinate and call you separately. You can receive >100 calls at night even when nothing urgent actually happened. Apart from that, most of them are unhelpful. They refuse to do ECG and never try set drips. They only call HO for every problem in the ward, and when they call you they don't know their own cases and cannot tell you the patient's background and vitals. And nurses from the same ward dislike each other and their seniors are also quite harsh to them, so the whole working environment is very toxic
- Support from senior: In our rotation only a few MOs are nice and willing to teach. Some of them get angry when we inform them of unstable cases or ask for help. Some seniors have strange expectations on what we should do. Intern coordinator did not try to arrange anything when HO on call has to take sick leave (COVID), just asked the remaining 2 HO to cover more wards. 
- Workload: Our rotation has fewer people than the previous rotation, so when colleagues get sick/post call half/AL, there is severe manpower shortage. MOs like to pan order a lot of investigations and consults so there are a lot of homework. However, after ordering they don't like to see the imaging/write down comments, so you have to see for them during on call. One (maybe) good thing is that they discuss DNACPR very early, so there are fewer arrest calls... But overall workload still so high that it is very difficult for you to spare time for non-compulsory stuff like joining rounds or doing procedures",NA,"M22",NA,3,"MED PMH"

Overall not many bedside procedures unless you are doing day ward (a few Zone 1 interns will be going to day ward). If doing day ward, will have a lot of bone marrow, some pleural / abdominal tap, skin biopsy etc. If not doing day ward, you can ask MO in ward, most of them are happy to supervise u / teach u if have procedures. if u are interested they will invite you to join them. you can also ask the day ward intern to let you do some procedures if interested","+ve
- Overall educational experience
- Most MO and seniors are very nice and willing to teach. Most will let you follow them round & teach. Some will let you pre-round and review your management with you. 
- Mentorship programme - Will be assigned 1 mentor, most mentors are nice and willing to teach, will let you follow them round 
- High degree of freedom during on call time. For many ward complaints the nurses will inform HO first, and you are often the first one to go assess and handle the patient even the case is lum. You can even adjust ventilator if you are confident. Good place to learn how to handle ward complaints independently
- Day time duty not too demanding. Have time to follow round & learn / squeeze time to watch some procedures if interested. If want to follow round can arrive at 9ish when most MO start to round, if don’t follow round can arrive ward when ward call you for homework e.g. 10am, often able to off work on time e.g. 5-530 pm. Often have time for lunch if no urgent thing 
- Previous intern coordinator is super nice and will treat us breakfast / coffee / blow water with us / teach. The new one is not as nice 
- No need to R scan at all. Only need to chut form. Even advance scan can be done by drafting memo to radi department 
- Generous evaluation in general - good for job hunting 

-ve
- Need to chut job sheet which is very stupid. Now day time they have hired some clerk to help you chut jobsheets, but during non-office hour you still have to chut all the jobsheets which is quite time consuming 
- On call worload is chur, often with > 100 calls per night. Many ward complaints, and quite often some of them are genuine lum cases that you need to handle / inform MO. May need to help take some admission blood / set HB in S block because phlebotomist wont’ take it. 
- Nurses in S block are in general quite incompetent & not nice, will call you at the middle of the night for trivial stuff eg NPS/TS jobsheet or lab results that are not urgent at all

1) nurses: they have the worst attitude and the poorest judgement and call quality, treating you like you're a dog and will talk behind your back to other doctors / make up bad things about intern and talk abt it in the nursing station LOUDLY as if they rule the entire world; they also reluctant to help with patient care, e.g. when they call you about an unstable patient and you ask about their vitals / PMH / current status, they would not answer you and will ask you to come assess yourself, and when u did, they will stick to their table of night food and you're the only one doing all the shits for the patients
2) blood gu support: basically they only appear Q8H - Q12H, worst in the infectious block (maybe appear once Q24H) so basically all the patients got no bloods taken and no beans set, and PMH got this shit culture that the nurses got used to the poor blood gu support and expect YOU to take the bloods (they would call you Q2H to ask you to take the admission bloods) and set the bean (for the so-called urgent antibiotics, or in fact for them to administer the usual drug just for their convenience so they won't miss the 'drug clock')
3) porter support: since nurse tend to bother you first then anyone else, for all escort they call you first, and when u arrive, you would find that nth is even ready, nor the patient and the oxylog machine / cardiac monitor / oximeter / escort nurse, and porter would be here after half an hour and if you go somewhere else for other things, porter leaves and ask you to call again
4) workload: at our times, we got manpower shortage due to covid isolation (esp when everyones' already 3d1c strict), meanwhile patient load climbing to the peak (medical overflow to all the wards even filling up S8-S9 which are supposed to be paedi ward, and each isolation cubicle got 3 patients which was suppose to be one only) with winter surge, daytime workload is already like on-call, and on-call time are basically Q1min call

minimal but good parts
1) dorm cleaning ladies: very kind and supportive, treat us snacks and food, make the dorm room very tidy
2) first call MOs: most very kind and friendly, dun mind you ask stupid questions / consult if unsure about the management, most would give you the whole mx suggestion if you ask about the condition and some would even hit bean / draw bloods with you in critical situation
3) cant think of anything related to PMH already but just wanna say my colleagues are the best, 患難見真情 it's really the hard time that make you realize how badly you're gonna die without the help of other interns e.g. in difficult blood taking, in times only 2 HO on call, when patient / nurses treated you badly and make you cry..... love you guys!","M22",NA,1,"MED PMH"

On the bright side, you will be learning the most standardised management, but the downside is they take everything really seriously (including taking ""urgent"" blood cultures before starting antibiotics, which will be the bulk of your workload when you are on call). There are not many opportunities to do procedures since even junior MOs barely have the chance to do procedures. If you are keen and pre-round, the MOs will teach you and it is a good learning opportunity. Otherwise during the day time, you're quite swamped with moliu work to be able to find the time to learn.

When you work as a houseman in PWH, you won't see those nice and friendly professors often, instead will mostly face junior MOs and nurses which most are notorious for being mean (there are exceptionally good ones though). 
The working culture in PWH is distorted. MOs working in PWH may have a weird sense of pride and the manifestation of that pride is by demeaning other colleagues (e.g. HOs, other MOs, nurses). MOs would AIRS other MOs/nurses as they think their colleague's management is suboptimal. Higher trainees would mock at basic trainees' admission management during call time. MOs have a Whatsapp group themselves, they will take pictures of HO's paai baan and mock at their management.
During call time, you will get blamed when you call MO for 'they think mo liu' stuff, but you will also get blamed the next day when you don't call MO and try to handle yourself ward complaints like low BP. It's a real hard struggle when you are thinking if you have to call MO or not. 
Intern coordinators often expect us to do a lot of procedures, but in real life you don't get the time to do (you are flooded with tedious blood taking work and d/c sum) and also MOs would need the chance to practice too, they won't easily let you try procedures.

- Manageable daytime workload as a medicine rotation. There is plenty of free time that allows interns to learn more (e.g. rounding patients, following specialty rounds, learning procedures, observing in endoscopy suite/ cath lab, joining grand rounds).
-  Educational value depends on your wish. No one will force you. Stay proactive if you want to learn more. 
- Friendly environment and good senior support. Seniors are always willing to teach and interact with you if you ask.
- Exposure to OPD but would not set target on you. Again, it depends on how much you want to learn.
- Relatively infrequent on call days (5-6/ month)
- Fair evaluation; follow ward rounds/ GI round to get reference letter 
Cons
- No post call half day
- On call hours can be crazily busy. Additional intern might be added for each call but that may increase frequency of call. (Really depending on total No of Interns in your rot)
- Nurses would direct all critical results/ unstable patients/ most ward complaints to MO. No exposure to handle these. 
- Nurses are not the most competent (except haematology), therefore frequently receiving unreasonable calls during on call hours. They did panic when patient deteriorated/ was in a critical condition (eg dangerously escorting unstable patients, lack of trust between nurses and interns in critical situation)

I didn't request specialty but I think there's not really any reason to unless you REALLY want to get into e.g. Cardi R1 because it looked busier/much lonelier. 

Pros: infrequent calls, 4 HO / night, usually reasonable sleep hours, post-call half and great socials if you have friends amongst the many HO (or make new ones)
Extensive DNACPR = rare arrest calls, less unindicated chores cf. other hospitals (e.g. no 6a ABG round here)
MO support is pretty good I think, very protective. Can learn from your mistakes without too much consequence or blame. CTB etc. WILL be double-checked which isn't the case everywhere. 
Nurses in most wards aren't too bad. Male wards might hit beans for you. 
In-ward pharmacists mean you don't even have to try figure out dc meds in daytime. 
Dorms are luxuoriously large with sea view, if a bit far. 

Cons: probably not the most educational MED if you're not pro-active like me but senior Mx here should be more reliable to learn from than some hospitals. tough calls before you learn to hit bean, tedious chore once you do. Poor phlebotomists, frequent conversion to arterial bloods aka you take. they make you use a Saturday for AL. Someone MUST go to OPD.

- If you are not keen to follow ward round, u can appear in ward at ~10-11am. HW can be done in around an hour for most of the ward. So you can lunch at around 12-1pm and chill in common room until ~3-4pm and clear the last round of hw before leaving

- Most ward complaints handled by you initially, so u can get exposed to various type of ward complaints and leaen how to handle it in the future
- You will be capable of handling almost all common ward complaints after this rotation
- Many good food to order for deliveries
- Houseman quarters is the best among all hospital. Clean, tidy and new.
- 2 CMS computer in HO room

Cons
- Many complicated cases and deteriorates fast
- If you are black, on call hours will be sunfu
- Lifts are slow in main block
- Need to sign name when taking tourniquet and sign again to dump the tourniquest everytime
- Some nurses are annoying

- Extremely high educational value, can learn lots of bedside procedures including abd tap, LP and pleural tap. Bone marrow is a compulsory procedure for rehab on call HO (can be pros and cons depends on how you think)
- Daytime workload is not heavy as expected because there are not so many clerical works (no jobsheets, blood gu is superb in NTWC)
- MOs are very nice. Wont scold even ask silly questions. Just dun hesitate to ask them.
- Some short call MOs will treat dinner!
- Working time can be at 1030-1100 when you do not follow the rounds. Can manage to finish HW in around 1.5-2 hours for majority of wards. That means your lunch hour can be from 1300-1500, or even hea till 1600 in call room
- HO call room is spacious. 2 beds, 1 sofa and 2 cms should be comfy enough for on call / hea during daytime.
- 1/3 calls are in rehab. Usually 4-5 hours sleep, one of the HOs have up to 10+ hours. If no CTB needs to be seen, sleep die till morning Hstix round is not impossible.
- Rounds are very educational. Feel free to follow!
- Many good food to order for deliveries (foodpanda / deliveroo)!
- Houseman quarters the best in Hong Kong. Clean and new, just like service apartment. 2 beds in each room (Previously 1 person 1 room as COVID ; seems will back to 2 person 1 room in R4 this year; so can be a drawback if you prefer single room)
- After TMH MED, you wont be afraid to handle 99% of ward complaints in other rotations. It is a good starting point for your internship!

Cons
- Many complicated and fragile cases. Might be frightened at first sight. Important to prioritize urgent stuffs as can have up to 4-5 wards call you together.
- Can 0 sleep if you are black. For example, 5 escort + 4 cert + 3 arrests in a night can be so terrible. Will get irritated especially waiting for the slow lifts in main block (Lifts will be fast after midnight)
- NTWC has a tradition which houseman need to sign and chop in order to take a tourniquet. Need to sign again when u dump the tourniquet. 
- ABG rounds can be horrible in B7. Can have up to 6-7 ventilator cases.
- 10 years passed by, still no ECG service in B9 during on call hours
- Tons of overflow wards. Some of them are extremely cautious. For example, call you for Na 134 and K3.4 when you are trying to sleep!
- T10, the renal ward, will call you 9am everyday. Can call you 5-6 times consecutively just for discharge summary / meds (Although nurses there are very nice, just too 'responsible')
- Clearing lab tests can be extremely sun fu because you cannot see the end. High patient loads with lots of blood tests / Xray means that you can see piles of them even you clear them q1h",NA,"M22",NA,5,"MED TMH"

It basically is a 6-week long interview, but it goes both ways, so you can really see whether you suit psychiatry and whether you like the vibe in TPH.

1. You are given responsibilities to do procedures such as AROM (which was scary at first but weirdly satisfying after you get a hang of it) and assisting Cesar’s (both elective and emergency) - some people like it some people don’t. 
2. Round cases - it’s compulsory, but for OBS super manageable especially postnatal (read bp chart carefully though!) and for GYN it is trickier but they don’t expect you to know everything. If you want to do well you can learn as you go, but nobody expects you to discharge patients and draft a home plan the first week (they might ask cause they forget it’s your first week lol). Imo it’s good MO training though because they really do trust you to do the first round 
3. Rehab - we all got fat. The workload really is manageable, especially if you help each other out. C2 is the busiest in the first hour then A2 is the busiest right before lunch. If your batch helps each other out you’re all guaranteed lunch at 12pm together. You can expect to get off work 5pm sharp, but if you’re keen you can help people out see more clinics - all up to you
4. Culture - people are nice. Some MO/AC might be scarier than the others but at the end of the day none of them was hostile or malignant. Some of them are actually super funny and down to earth. 
5. Expectations - seriously not that high. please really do show up to emergencies they call you for especially if it’s in labour ward. Admission is compulsory but most MOs are fast in admitting. Past 12am admissions are really yours though. Don’t miss it. Even gyne cases can be life threatening 
6. Don’t over rely on nurses - “流少少血” could be a massive Hb drop. “Bp ok” could be tachycardia. Just go see and admit that patient then sleep.

6 working days + pre-rest day calls mean you are ""jailed"" by the department (I worked for 30/31 days in a month LOL ><) 
Can swap calls with mates by swapping dect phones (but make sure DONT LET INTERN COORDINATOR/SECRETARY knows) 
Can swap duties too (in our rot i took up all USG sessions while future surgeons took up all the CS duties) 
Can be educational if you are keen to follow clinics, doctors are happy to teach if you ask
OG curriculum doesnt require rotating out so the doctors are good in OG but dont expect much on medical management (and they will frequently consult medical for trivial stuff)","Think twice if you wanna do OG.
College requirement of ~8 calls per month + on-site call even for AC are dreadful

The reason for a 2 out of 5 score is due to the expectation reality gap and the immense pressure from seniors.

They expect all adm must be done within 1 hr (when there are many adm coming from mainland china due to gate opening) and call senior with borderline abnormal lab result. Otherwise you will be scolded in the whatsapp gp or received personal calls from multiple seniors even after you are post call. And there are many MO on leave one after another, so in the end all of us need to arrive at ward at around 0730-0740 to do ward rounds almost every day which is very tiring in rot 3. 
Educational value is a lot if you are keen on surgery or Ortho. You can enter OT and even get to do many LA lists with seniors.  can even complete CR before MO adm. Seniors are willing to teach. And this is quite a renowned spine centre so many different spine procedures can be found here.

Workload is really light.Got so much free time during daytime and call time. Also leave arrangement is so generous. 9A-5P, post call half at 1P, compen for Saturday calls.
But try not to come in R1, coz you will have a false perception that houseman life is good and will get into depression wherever you go in R2. Also not so recommended for those who want to get into paedi trainee post, coz TKOH is a small centre, may not hire ppl every year. There is no NICU, just one general paedi ward, so you won't see neonates, can be good or bad (good for you don't have to hit those difficult neonates beans, bad for less exposure).
Down side is straight 3d1c, but if you have good luck, you can have complete bed rest. By complete bed rest, I mean really zero phone calls, you will even start to doubt if your dect phone got broken. But if you have bad luck, may have to wake up at 0am, 2am, 4am, 6am to admit cases, then sleep quality can be really bad. But anyway you can leave at 1pm (post-call half). Straight 3d1c also means 3d1 post call half, you have so many free afternoons to spend in a month :D!!!
Another down side is MOs can be gossipy. They can be passive aggressive when you admit cases late, or are bad at hitting beans.

I really don't ask / need to be appreciated for my work as a HO but they least they could do was not actively hate on you after a very reasonable effort to do things for them and improve. I knew PAED was petty in general but I think it's probably worse here.

Some VERY rude/unhelpful nurses in Neonatal, general ones are decent. Never imagined such stressful daily interactions. Some MOs do kind of mind if you can't get bloods despite what they have to say in the briefing. Majority are decently nice, but a few bad apples are enough to ruin your time.

Quite a decent rotation regardless of order. Maybe not the MOST educational if you actually want to become a surgeon since they don't have everything and you mostly type dc / take T&S if you don't follow round or go OT (not compul at all) but you can of course choose to BJ with the extra time here. 

Post- AM round hw can be substantial, but after that you can do what you want until PM round hw comes in. Despite the frequent call schedule, it's almost always complete bed rest after midnight as case admission is MO duty and most of them won't leave hw for you and the cases here are relatively stable. Weekend calls can be quite tough and lonely + you pretty much have one every week you're not on AL. Excellent phlebotomist support (no beans or culture!) just call them if you can't get a T&S. Nurses and seniors are pretty friendly and competent, esp. 3S. 

Eat lunch in the same room as MOs, decent rapport compared to other depts.

Only d/c sum for cases who stayed not more than 5 days. NTWC very good phlebotomist support. No need to print job sheets!!!","POH Surg used to be rehab place in previous years' review. But recently the department has expanded from 2 wards to 4 wards, while the number of HOs remain as 3. Workload has been more than before. When one HO is on AL, the other 2 may have a tough time. 
They won't force you to pre-round cases, or follow rounds in R3-4. Also there is no EOT during call time in POH. That means 1st call MO always is physically present to admit cases. If good luck can stay all night inside call room and do all admission hw by iPad only. Nurses are really nice and competent, they will sometimes invite HOs to order food delivery tgt. And no need to print jobsheets which save you a lot of time and energy. Intern coordinator is really nice. She really would listen to our feedbacks and make changes accordingly. I would rate POH SUR as an above average Surgery rotation, given that call time workload is quite manageable.
But, weekend lone calls can be tough, just don't aim to finish all hw before having lunch, or you won't have lunch. Also the BIGGEST problem is that there is no post call half in POH Surg. Working 8A-6P without post call half is really a torture. If you don't have quarter, then you need maybe an extra 2 hours to commute every day, and you will literally have no personal life for 3 months. When back to home you are too exhausted you just want to eat, shower then sleep.

5. SACC (daycare centre) is a pain in the Axx, but its part of the fun of being HOs (woof woof)","Very good choice for Ro 1 and those want to do SURG. 
All seniors and MOs are nice and willing to teach/give you opportunities, esp for a Uni hospital. No hierachy/toxic environment. 
Also because have lots of HO (>20), call frequency is very low.

","1. The rotation is split into 2 x 1.5 month. 1.5 month of gen surg (team 1 = HBP, Team 2 = UGI, Team 3 = LGI) , and 1.5month of jarp surg (pedi surg, uro, plastic, vascular, NS, CTS). Technically they don't let you choose openly, but you can email the sec earlier to show your preference, seems like they will follow your preference most of the choice.
2. Team based, so each team for GEN SURG will have 3-4 HO, and 1-2 HO for jarp surg team. each team has cases in every ward so the HOs will go around wards only taking care of their team's cases. hence 'flexible duty arrangement' is good or not 見仁見智. if the other HO in your team like to seh bok then you can eat shit since you will carry whole team.
3. DO NOT CHOOSE PEDISURG if you want to do surg, unless you really wanna do pedi surg. the team consists of menopausal women who bad mood 247, and patient load is very little (worst I've seen is 1 case only). HO independence is shit, you get nothing except insults and sacral sore from sitting too long in HO room doing nothing. 

Gen surg:
- team 1 = nice seniors, most freedom to HO in terms of how much they want to engage, least patient load out of the 3
- team 2 = enders 大大 (iykyk), compul round and old, 2hrs long grand round, a bit more pressure/chur but good learning opportunities
- team 3 = very nice seniors and lots of learning opportunities but HUGE PATIENT LOAD may have to round till 2046. 

Jarp surg
- pedi surg = do not choose or you will regret being born
- uro = seems like the best choice out of jarp surg. 
- CTS: quite specialised and chur seniors.

What kind of SHITHOLE start with 8 HO and end with 6? Two HO dropped out. 
UCH surgery single handedly will create a manpower shortage problem for the HA

1. Impossible workload

The workload is beyond what can be reasonably expected of a normal human being. Routinely have to skip peeing, eating and sleeping while being assaulted by nurses and seniors. UCH serves the entire Kowloon east, the workload and turnover is so huge that you are unable to familiarise with any cases or afford to spend more than 5min on one patient.  Almost all interns in our rotation end up with some kind of work-induced medical illness.  

  2. Malignant environment and exploitative 

   Made worse 10x by poor management. Ppl here including secretory have really bad attitude and are unhelpful. On9 timetables with very unbalanced calls, will have you 9 calls one month and 2 calls the other.  You will have a taste of all kinds of strictly ‘legal’ but strange and unnecessary call arrangements like short call immediately after long call etc. The memory of UCH surgery made me want to throw up.  It is impossible to do one ward by one HO as pointed out in previous years. Any request for a better delegation of workload will be ignored. The intern coordinator Zoe Yip, rather than accommodating interns, her  favourite activity was shouting at /gaslighting interns and swearing at cleaners. 

   Some nurses and the ward managers are quite malicious. They will actively distract you from your job (purposely sharpening pencil next to you or opening the TV when you are taking blood), yes I know quite hard to believe. Ask you to see a patient but not inform you that he is HIV positive or demented, it is quite a dangerous place for HO to work in. 

 3. Poor and badly managed hospital

  Also will not recommend UCH in general. It is infamous for medical incidents.  Badly managed, stretched in resources and filled with uneducated ppl. 

  4. Risk of bad evaluation and limited educational value

   Don’t feel like a doctor or are helping the patients. 70% of the work is mind-numbing job sheets that a donkey can do, but you will be forced to do while sacrificing your sleep and health while learning nothing. Expect to be called at 4am x K3.3 or reprinting lost job sheet. The nurse will verbally attack or abuse interns and this is joined by the intern coordinator. They will force you to open various on9 and dangerous drugs and makes you question why you are doing this job in the first place.

 I feel bad for anyone who has to come here, I am still recovering from the trauma physically and mentally, but no one will speak for us, because as quoted by Dr Yip, we are ‘small potates’ and should just suck it up. She will talk shit to your future employer and call you when you are interviewing with the COS.  (They will trick you into signing a paper consenting to being contacted via your personal no. on your AL, DO NOT sign the paper).

The intern coordinators have a group where they will post location of procedures that are about to happen, but usually observe/assist. If you want to do loads of LP/BM/tapping then maybe choose peripherals.","Love/hate relationship with this rotation. It was quite hellish in the beginning. My friends and I left work around 9pm daily for the first 2 weeks. It was also very lonely as there are 17-20+ houseman, but most people are strangers. After about a month, we got to know each other a bit better, and it became a lot more bearable. New block is somewhat more solo working style as you each have your own wards (or two). Old block can have multiple people clearing simultaneously which ends up being more fun. Daytime decent educational value if you follow rounds and read paiban, but still 70% clerical work common to all medical rotations. Some wards like 10BC, 12AC higher educational value during daytime as more unstable patients. Call period very high educational value due to the quantity of ward complaints along with great senior support if you request it. You can do some ABCD, start BiPAP/inopressors, cardiovert someone unstable, give sedation, start fentanyl for end-of-life patients in pain, give comfort antipsychotics to restrained dementia patients etc. Overall it was a painful rotation, and we started counting down from day 76, but looking back I had a good time, great education, and it made me a better doctor. I ranked this as my last choice when applying and was sent here anyway, but in the end, if given the chance to go back in time, I would still choose to spend my Ro2 in PWH MED again.","Lack of ventilators in med is a drawback. There also seemed to be a lot of worry about getting scolded/callback by MO. I think that was quite rare. I was told off ~2-3 times in the entire rotation, twice for bullshit reasons. Overall it is not as toxic as its reputation. It is just the same as any other place. The intern coordinator(s)/KM Chow have also tried to make your life better by optimizing the duty roster, creating post call half, and increasing cul gu quota. The nurses here are probably average. Some are mostly concerned with avoiding responsibility/blame and playing the medicolegal game, but that's how it is. At least in medical the nurses can somewhat differentiate between what is urgent and what is not, unlike O&G nurses. Some nurses like to make you call MO for the much more unstable patients, but that's up to you. If you want to let your MO sleep, then by all means do so. Just don't kill anyone.

6 FULL work days
Work distribution very uneven among HO
Need to cover 2 lines at least twice every month (which is 2-3 people geh workload, insane). 
Day time duty from 9am-6pm, post call off at 2pm. Usually can off work on time, unless need cover other lines.
MOs are generally nice but some will pan draw blood culture abg ecg urgent consult urgent scans
Nurses are not as competent as expected, will call you for K3.2/ change dc meds/ improving TnI trend in the middle of the night.
Cannot verbal order/ type in progress notes for most things. Need to physically write in paai baan in person for stuff like hyper/hypoK, comment XR, restraints, transfusion order.
Always need to spend time do repetitive hw like 罰抄 MOs verbal orders/ help MO change dc meds/ sign labs that are already read by MO/ help MO print progress notes
Need to go to Radi department to r scan, even for CTB.
Need to do ECGs from 5pm to 8am, most are not indicated and you can leave it u til morning blood gu do. 
No HO room or call room. On call either sleep in common area sofa/ dayward. 
Intern coordinator not nice at all, does not help/ report HO that does not do work/ always take leave and even tolerates them. Instead question why post call HO is resting in common sofa but not following morning rounds (which is not compul)…????","Only thing good about QEH Med:

Dismissive and authoritarian by doctors towards intern, you are not part of the team. 14 houseman in my rotation is too little, work like a dog. Seniors 冇當你係人 sorry.

Intern coordinators (fat woman and bald man) is rubbish. There’s a guy houseman in our rot who is lazy and stupid af, cert one case need hours, leaves tropI 10000 unattended and other dangerous shit, rude to nurses and other HO. But he goes unpunished whole rotation despite many HO and wards complain him, so you can see how 有作為 the high-ups are. They only knows how to reinforce their commands and requirements over and over again without changing the circumstances. 

The seniors only know how to diu9 you for not following rounds/ go to postgrad meetings. D small MO 自身難保 no time to give u shit.

Daytime duty is sometimes manageable for some wards morning. Then afternoon some people post call and you have to cover their wards (LINE of wards, not a single ward) in addition to yours then hell breaks loose. You have to face the moral dilemma of preserving your rest time by leaving on time with work undone/ leave 7-730pm every f**ing day. I suggest you do the former cuz even if you OT won’t be appreciated either.

Call is hell. ECG + bloods 
3 HO on call every night but is actually equal to lone call.

Forget about educational opportunities because you are too tired/ too busy being 血姑 to learn shit. But you do learn to survive because everything is so lum here. You have to accept the low standard of care here (e.g ECG bloods left overnight, timed ABG is not late if taken within 2h of ordered time😂) 

Most ward nurses competent, the ones who are blacklisted is C11, F10, F8… especially F10.

Pros
1.     Inspiring lectures, only if you can squeeze time to attend
2.     Great place to learn bedside vscan echo (a lot of MO will do bedside vscan during admission) 
3.     You may become bean god after this rotation (after blood, sweat and tears)
Cons 
1.     Basically everything done by HO (from clerical work like dc summary, to hitting beans, to R scan, to admit case, see OPD, explain ward follow up)  
2.     Compulsory ward follow up, OPD, you may have to deal with SFI scan/holter results that you don’t know how to interpret and have to find MO; or you have to see OPD patients like ehler danlos syndrome/ IgG4/ complete heart block unsupervised
3.     All beans by HO, aka all medical frail/ oedematous/ drug addict bean that may cost you 30mins- 1 hour + getting hit and kicked by delirious ah por
4.     Very protected, most ward complaint/ urgent/ acute stuff handled by MO
5.     BD round
6.     Discharge summary, death summary by HO; could have 10-20 discharge summary per day  
7.     Specialty call no post call half (so after on call you have to manage 3 wards on your own until 6 pm next day); weekend specialty call you have to answer call to 10+ wards on all discharge summary/ urgent beans, travelling between block K and main block
8.     Not as chill as described despite the large number of HO; at least 6-7 calls per month
9.     Allegedly 3 HO per general ward, but usually you will lose manpower due to compen/ annual leave/ OPD, and secretary likes to arrange people to have annual/ compen together, so worst you can expect solo deal with 8 WFU, 10+ dc summary and all hw 
10.  Some MO can disappear during call and you have to admit all cases + hit beans + draw blood culture for all admission
11.  Nurses are competent, but they also have a lot to comment on your management 
12.  Cases are quite well, does not reflect the real internal medicine patient population
13.  Many urgent scans, radiologists are more benign though (but varies rotation from rotation), but quite brainless to go down to radio during 4am just to use their phone to call radiologist 
14.  Very high turnover, many discharge within 1 day (boring pneumonia, fluid overload), new admission, so you may not catch up with/ drill on some cases

2. Compul sit 4 OPDs/ month, but most HO in my rot skipped all with no consequences (no time go anyway).
3. Some MOs force your E adm case when they have other duties/ are too slow at admitted cases.
4. Day center no procedure do, but day ward HO has to admit all day cases and draw T/S, ABG, sign consent, chut sick leaves, (on average takes ~1hr every morning). Day center staff very kind and helpful.
5. Phlebotomist support: absolutely atrocious. On average much more incompetent than other centers, severely understaffed, no system to call urgent blood so all urgent blood/ HBs by HOs, some straight up refuses bloods they forgot to do/ demands HO to do their duties citing ""too busy"" as a reason, forgetting to use magic stick before blood c/st -> tell the nurses they are unable to draw blood cul so HO has to do it. (This is a known issue among MOs. We complained to Intern Coor who let us submit to the COS a log of failed bloods/long phlebo waiting time -> 80+ such incidences over 2 weeks) As a result you get multiple calls from wards for ""urgent bloods/ beans"" every day, many of these are not actually urgent because some nurse here are unable tell between truly urgent and semi/non-urgent issues.","Nice MOs, terrible education value, incompetent nurses and phlebotomists","Pros:
1) Nice MOs, many are very responsible, some even do their own homework.
2) Dub lab/ see imaging by MO (so the person most familiar with the case see their own results... instead of HO chopping through mountains of labs knowing little about the patients).
3) Have HO room so more cohesion between HOs.
4) Excellent AL arrangements, can get consecutive day offs for long trip.
5) Good for patients: good radiologists who actually want to help the patient and are interested in the cases regardless of whether they are annoyed with you/ your MO, as a result most indicated scans are approved/ most non-ultra-urgent scans are done next morning. Good radiographer as well (one volunteered liver arteriogram for LT workup CT).
6) Good for patients: routine consults are attended very quickly.
7) Good for patients: extremely high quality USG machines in acute wards allowing Echo/ USG abd/ USG difficult beans.
8) Good for patients: short A&E waiting time.
9) Good for patients: stroke call whole process done very quickly, scans get done -> patient get tPA/ escorted for IA with minimal delay.

Cons:
1) Few ward procedures.
2) Blood forms including MRA/CPA/VRE/Candida auris screening by HO. Even readmission slips are done by HO.....
3) Extremely poor phlebotomist support as mentioned previously.
4) Ward complaints call MO (not like lone call HO has time to handle anyway). Absolutely not recommended as first 2 rotations for low educational value, but also not recommended as last 2 rotations for being too dumb.
5) Many nurses are incompetent. Call you for non-urgent issues (late-night 補K, panadol, laxatives, clerical stuff). Some call MO simultaneously even for hypoK which must be frustrating for them. Huge pager call volume because they do not accumulate calls. Up to 20 calls per hour before 10pm when on call. Best wards are A7/B7/B6D(day)+/-A10, worst are B3(rehab)/A4/B4(infirm)/B10+/-A6/C7PC(palliative, low workload but nurses knowledge-deficient). One nurse in B8 (surgical, have med overflow) always demand you to personally read the progress notes and chut jobsheet even for a handful of routine bloods and XRs which is just stupid.
6) Infirmary ward nurses are extremely lazy. High fever don't want CXR, wound swab, Q4H obs.
7) Poor ACLS. Nurses slow, poor quality CPR unless you/ rare good nurses do it yourselves, slow to 1st dose adren (coz most nurses mm sik/ forgot interpret initial rhythm), poor time keeping between adren doses and pulse checking. (Good things in ACLS here is most MO knows how to intubate/ can even try it yourselves).
8) Shared call room with MOs (tho all of them are great people). Counterpoint is you can learn about their daily work, and what low quality calls they get from nurses as well.
9) Bad for patients: no Renal/ Uro/ OG/ Psy. Especially poor Urological management in RH Med.

You have lone call for the entire MEDICAL department, felt more like the ENTIRE HOSPITAL because most wards are medical anyways along with overflows to SUR and ORTHO.

Pros: nice and approachable MO, daytime really quite chill because no d/c sum, no compulsory admission and most MOs will do all IPMOE, job sheets, consults and scans.

- It’s the place where I learned the most about the basics of being a doctor. Here houseman independence is max, you will be responsible for handling all kinds of emergencies. You will attend things like headache (can be new onset ICH), decreased GC (multiple cases of new stroke), chest pain (always think of ACS / AD / PE / PTx as they pop up often), hypotension (remember the basics from med school, and yes HO can order dopamine infusion), tachycardia (VT/SVT/fast AF 放題), desaturation (you will learn about and frequently use NIV / intubation), abd pain or GI bleeding (it can be fresh melena with plummeting BP or acute abdomen with free gas on CXR), limb pain (once turned out to be compartment syndrome), witnessed arrest (pls shout for help) and all sorts of “lum” things you thought you will only see on textbooks. It might be intimidating at first, but you soon will gain momentum and realize that your management as a first-year doctor could save lives. Even in situations beyond your capacity, your senior is always ready to help and answer any ""stupid questions"" encouragingly. Scolding or blaming an intern is a rare thing here as interns are deemed as an integral part of the department instead of SOLs. Instead, constructive feedbacks are given which facilitates your professional development.

- It's the place where you are still required to do piles of clerical work, but not so overwhelming that you can still take your time to learn. Phlebotomist support is exceptionally outstanding, 血姑s are omnipresent and omnipotent so that you can focus on being a doctor. You can always volunteer (i.e. not being forced) to try procedures like chest / abd tap, LP, chest drain, suturing, joint tap or even CVC / intubation etc. (only bone marrow biopsy is compulsory for rehab block on-call intern), with just the right amount of supervision and support. I am also immensely grateful to my supervisors, who inspired me with their expert ways of rounding patients (+ allowing me to do some ward round) and delivering holistic care.

- It's the place where you can meet great friends and enjoy life besides work.

- KWH only has direct call, so even the most trivial things can be direct call
- KWH no need blood taking / ABG unless difficult blood, which is a good thing for workload in later rotations but terrible for learning purposes in first rotation
- Nurses at KWH OG ?cannot access Ix request, needless to say do job requests themselves
- Somehow for obstetric pts KWH OG nurses cannot / will not do ECG or take CPE / VRE / Candida auris swab (which is actually quite common)
- KWH OG HO mandatory admit cases then MO follow, only very rarely MO admit before you
- No verbal order by HO, everything must write in kardex, if MO verbal order, you have to go write it
- ""Mx: see kardex"" is the one of the weirdest traditions I have seen

Doctor factor
- There was one doctor that I really admired and respected, props to him
- Most people are indifferent to your existence, which is fair
- Notable minority will be very eager to remind you to behave, whilst demonstrating ineffective communication skills and how 離地 they are 
- The department has a ""research project"", can't tell if they are actually serious about it or just handing in homework, good luck getting it published
- Personally believe that a certain team head is a ""septic source"" in the department and creating pressure for everyone, not very self-aware, hope retire soon but probably not going anywhere

Nurse factor
- Most nurses / midwives are ok
- However few nurses horrendous, particularly one IC, attitude issues, intrude into your work, act like a 太監
- Please be professional?? Your attitude is part of your job too

Team factor
- GYN: will be reminded to show up to ward at 8 to ""round"" by some people, but not too sure why we expected to round: MO AM round workload is a moderate only, nor is our rounding given constructive feedback
- GYN: if team head rounding (at 930, few times per week), expect HO to hold up obs chart like a stand, better hope you have no shoulder problems
- OBS: compulsory round postnatal patients, a little tedious but very brainless

Day duty factor
- Ward duty: mainly just admit cases and do homework, straightforward
- AM OPD duty: clerk cases before they see MO, actually see cases under supervision of an ex-COS, very occasionally need to sit around like a student and do fuck all
- PM colposcopy clinic: pap smear simulator
- PM ""R"" clinic: show up to OPD to recruit patients for ""research project"", this is when you realise you are free labour
- OT duty: occasionally need to follow gyn OT, degree of involvement highly variable on doctor and surgery, but even nothing to do still need you to be there
- DC sum duty: for some reason this department likes to accumulate its DC sums and not do them ASAP upon pt discharge, hence there is a collection of dc sums. For gyn dc sum, team head will chase you up at the end of the month and threaten you to finish in time or ""I will tell your supervisor"" (oh ok)

On call factor
- Call workload really depends on how lucky you are
- Weekday: daytime only delivery ward, past 530 + gyn ward and obs ward
- Weekend: long call do delivery and obs ward, short call do gyn ward until 10pm
- Holiday: solo do everything
- Rarely require enter C/S which is good as you do nearly nothing ""assisting"" the surgery as there is a senior and MO already in there
- OG is rarely truly ""urgent"" at a HO level, but you are expected to attend everything in person ASAP, which really takes away from sleeping time
- Work usually cannot be completed remotely (e.g. admissions, print T&S)

Nurses are also dumb af (don’t know the difference between wbc and cbc, don’t know that Tft means t4 and tsh then insist on asking MOs because the only explanation in their eyes is that the houseman is wrong). Oh and rectal swabs for CPE VRE screening will fall on the HOUSEMAN  (every single hospital in the planet will not ask a doctor to do these screenings…)
Nurses also are so rude, enjoy calling you names behind your back but in front of other houseman, lie about times they informed you about cases, and lie about difficult blood taking so they don’t have to take bloods - and have the audacity to discuss their scheme in front of other houseman…) plus one of the nurses physically searched me just because she thought I took her pen even though I told her I didn’t…

Just when you feel bad for the MOs to have to work in hell, you’re reminded that they are also equally bad. They are so petty that they will call you back to clarify if an examination room was truly occupied then proceed to lecture you even after a valid explanation, get angry that you are in the bathroom the mornings of post call (because basic hygiene and self care is not warranted!!!) plus they also stand on the nurses’ side and suck up to them.

You will excel in labeling printing with shortcuts and enjoy your three week internship as a professional HA clerk in D7.

A7 gyn: Lots of mindless d/c, pre op T&S and many “urgent” job sheets. Nice nurses and you mostly work as a blood gu, sometimes they will ask you to take urgent bloods that aren’t that urgent claiming that no blood gu will come (it was 12 noon??). Otherwise, workload is manageable just, but d/c sum will magically appear throughout the day to keep you busy.

B7 obs: nicest nurses, but need to round PN cases, though just daily dictation x 10-15. Many mindless d/c sum, otherwise chilliest ward

C7 labor ward; variable workload, but they are sometimes inch and expect you to be there immediately. They enjoy Q1H take t&s and call EA (force you to go there and call anaes and then write on chart) in the middle of the night. If you are not too black, usually just 0-3 cases at night, but they like to spread out the workload over time and limit ur bed time. Compulsory assisting in all elective and emergency CS, usually 1-3 cases on Mon Wed and Fri. Also 7am repeated calls to print newborn screening labels, they will keep on calling Q15mins if you don’t print.

F8 private ward: compulsory daily round all PN cases, usually fewer than 8 cases. Nurses will serve you round with a trolley.

Relieving intern: Mon Wed Fri OT day, u will hold the uterus for 3 hours in lap OT. Otherwise you are relieved for the rest of the time.

Overall good rehab rot: nice MO, most with free dinner. Bedtime varies from 1-6 hours depending on whether u got Em LSCS, usually just 1 or none :DD (most days). PY has lowest C/S rate out of all HA hospitals. Many mindless and menial tasks that nurses expects you to do urgently, you can enjoy being a brainless job sheet machine and blood gu for 3 months!!

However, I can say they have changed A LOT since and have become much more intern-friendly :)

Daytime workload:
You don’t have a fixed ward but will be assigned one of the following duties every day:
- GYN ward (A2): Compulsory first round for one cubicle then present cases to senior for second round; then ward duties like d/c sums, blood-taking, IPMOE, etc. It’s stressful initially because you know almost nothing and everything you ordered will be followed seriously; but don’t worry, everyone is willing to help!
- OBS ward (C2): Also compulsory first round, then present cases for second round and table round (i.e. to all OBS team seniors). Then you will perform the usual ward duties. Every day they C adm lots of IOL (induction of labor) cases and you need to “餐” them (hit 16G HB and take T&S). 
- Postnatal ward (E2/G2): round as many PN cases as possible then MO will countersign. It’s super easy, just follow a template.
- Private ward (A11): also morning round with a mix of AN / PN cases. A11 HO will also help with day center clerical work like 出藥紙
- Labor ward (B4): you will sometimes be called to handle emergencies (your role: execute MO orders like 抽血打豆開藥), examine newborn babies and call paedi for assessment if needed (they have guidelines / forms to follow, and babies are SUPER CUTE!!!). If there are IOL cases, you will perform AROM (i.e. 穿水, which is a weirdly satisfying procedure)
- C/S duty: everyone will have ~2 weeks to scrub in and assist with daytime C/S – see if you like doing OT lol if not, then it’s really tiring.
- OPD: You will be assigned multiple AN / GYN / USG OPD sessions, but tbh just go once each and its enough
- Every Friday: departmental lunch meeting (with free lunch!!)
- Optional: conduct NSD (teaching will be provided), follow GYN OT

Call:
One OBS and one GYN call per night, total 6-8 call per month all with post-call half at 1 pm.
The real emergencies will be handled promptly by on-call MO, you will just help with blood-taking, IPMOE, R scans etc. Other ward complaints, even the very trivial ones (like sinus tachy 105bpm) will be reviewed by MO after you have seen them. Low HO independence, but you can learn from observation.
You will be called for new cases and is expected to admit them (including PV / speculum exam if applicable, but USG is not expected). But you will not be blamed if occ delayed. MO will monitor the list and admit themselves too.
** Overall sleep time… depends, can range from 1 to 6 hours lol

Culture""
VERY DIFFERENT from “the PowerPoint” - I would say most of the doctors are kind and willing to teach, will not intentionally pick on interns or use very malignant language (even if you made mistakes). COS and intern coordinator arrange regular meetings with interns and will really listen to our opinion. On call team often will invite you to dinner and have a nice chat. Thanks for the great times!
Midwives / nurses: midwives sometimes can be annoying / emotional / borderline verbally abusive esp when there’s an emergency; but most of them are really professional and you just need to follow what they say. Most of the times they are quite friendly.
No more post-call rest day / post-call AL / Sunday CL / 2-day-1-call that kind of BS. But still, no case MO though, so sometimes you are left with extremely complicated and unorganized cases with different imp / mx daily lol.

Overall:
A good rotation, comfortable atmosphere, perfect balance of working (ward round, admission etc., tiring but useful experience) and relaxing (we ate A LOT of 恒輝雞煲 / picnic in the garden / BBQ in QEH / good takeaway food and lots of bedrest / Switch lol)

Bad:
1.⁠ ⁠Hostile towards HO in general. E.g. on the FIRST day of work, intern coordinator said their COS knows many COS of different hospitals and can rescind our offer which is like wtf.

2.⁠ ⁠Very low level of HO independence. HO admit case but probably the only reason is to achieve the 1 hour benchmark of admitting case. Even if MO's admission management is same as HO, they will copy it again which makes HO feel their effort is ignored. Expected to call MO for many ward complaints / after case admission. When dealing with ward complaints, even if HO write simple management like CBC / CXR, will get doubted the next day (or even call back) on why they made this decision.

You will suffer, regret and question the meaning of life. It's not about the workload, but the atmosphere here is mentally toxic. 
 
Nurses  
- Are notorious for their professional *in*competence and rudeness to doctors.
- They are supposed to help, but many a time they will just demand you, with a demeaning attitude (or even by yelling / screaming / directly throwing paiban on your keyboard while you’re typing) to urgently do their non-urgent stuff.  
- Actually some of them extend their poor attitude towards patients and their families, which led to cases of complaints. They talk back to / talk shit behind junior MOs as well. One nurse said she wanted to 扭甩 xxx (a junior MO) 個頭 for something trivial which is rly wtf.
- Do not expect help from them, because their knowledge to their patients’ condition and treatment, or even the nature of the homework they ask you to do, is limited.
- Do not expect nurses to 跟檔 here, you will have to get your own stuff, do the procedure on your own, apply prolonged compressions by yourself, and clean up the mess. Even 跟檔 requests by non-surg MO coming for a consult was blatantly rejected (which pissed them off.) 
- You also have to call 6020 中央組送血 x ABG T&S by yourself. -_-
- Your tiniest little actions in the ward will be monitored, wide-spreaded and complained about by nurses. Someone got called back for accidentally spilling water on the table. 
- They seem to have never learned SBAR. They will make calls like “houseman, patient c/o pain, bye”, “patient BP sky high, bye” or “admitted a case, bye”; if you attempt to ask further (like “what’s his BP?”), they will explode. (A nurse exploded when an MO tried to ask) 
 
Junior doctors 
- To be fair most of junior MOs are nice, responsible, well-equipped with medical knowledge, willing to teach and treated interns as part of the team. I am grateful to them. (Many of them rotated in from somewhere else) 
- Meanwhile, some are late 1.5 hrs for work, vastly disappearing during on-call and repeatedly blamed interns for not helping with their admissions, even if they knew interns were already occupied by other urgent stuff for hours.
 
Senior doctors 
- Classical surgeon tempers with a special interest in office politics and micromanagement (in collaboration with nurses and supporting staff)
- You will be yelled at, called out by full name, and called back at 6 AM, for very minor mistakes (like wrong format of admission notes).  This applies not only to interns but also to junior MOs. 
- Some will disregard contributions made by interns. A senior forbid junior MOs to write “thank you HO for your assessment” in admission notes. Another senior claimed that assessments like PR exam by HO is deemed less accurate. 
- A senior specialized in, apart from surgery, removing miscellaneous items around intern lockers. They even had a meeting for that. 
- “Food for thought” quotes from them:  
- “You guys are called house officers because you don’t have an office, you are supposed to be in-house, i.e. your ward all the time during work” 
- “You know medicine is a small world, our COS may know your future COS, we may exchange information about you” (fyi I have medical student friends too)
- Do not expect anyone to listen to your opinion. They will just require you to 忍/入鄉隨俗 to subpar things. 
 
Educational value and facilities 
- You will be assigned to a team but work ward-based. Ward work is 80% clicking jobsheets (CBC LRFT those), IPMOE, writing DC sums and other miscellaneous paperwork. 20% would be urgent scans / urgent consultations, you will soon learn when NOT to order these as an MO.
- You are required to follow senior round + sometimes grand round +/- pre-round cases (we didn’t), but senior may not talk to / teach you. 
- The most educational part would be admitting new cases, where you will learn to assess and formulate Mx for common surgical cases. But bear in mind, you will neither have time nor energy for that. 
- No real place for lunch as all pantry seats are occupied / pre-occupied / deemed theirs by nurses and supporting staff. No canteen / 711 as well, only cafe330. We sat on the FLOOR of a corridor during lunchtime for more than a month. 
- One tiny call room with a comfortable bed (no CMS inside), otherwise no real place for you to rest. We were deemed “an eyesore” by a senior for gathering around a departmental sofa. 
- Short call (till 0000, ~2-4/month) and long call (overnight, ~3-4/month), no post-call half (but that’s the norm for surgery) 
- Longest working hour of 0800-1800; some MO will come back at 0700 for round. 

Finally, I would like to recap a comment made by 2022-23 senior:

""Very demanding cultures. No life at all. My most depressing rotation"" and ""HELL. Don’t go"".
 
If you read all these and still decide to get in, please accept my utmost respect and admiration to your bravery, good luck. 
 
If you, unfortunately, get assigned and cannot swap it away, have hope and constantly remind yourself of your 初心 in becoming a doctor. Misery will pass, you will overpower it and give it your own meaning. Appreciate yourself, don't await someone else's. Remember the smallest things (like being nice to patients, contrary to some nurses) could be a huge blessing to patients and our society. Good luck as well.

Junior MOs are usually nice, but seniors will definitely question and occasionally rip into you for ordering ""excessive investigations"" (e.g. septic workup for a post op patient with chills and 39'C fever, ordering erect CXR and AXR for a patient with stoma bleed). During on call, to prevent being called back by seniors the next day, just inform the 1st call for EVERYTHING you find even slgihtly shady. The best management here is to inform MO and get them to deal with it (or approve your management). 

They are also absolute hypocrites. As an intern coordinator once said, ""houseman means in the house, so your office is in the ward"", meanwhile MOs goes out for lunch and even dinner during call. One AC complained we are coming in ""late"" as he saw one of us in the MTR at 830 (which is not true), but this means he was the one that was late as hell.

Calls are not too frequent (again due to high HO (13) to ward (5) ratio), and they mostly find MO's for actual urgent things so can sleep quite a lot.

Seniors are nice and willing to teach, and will buy you dinner :D. Nurses will directly find seniors for you for urgent things, no need to call and be scared.

If they screened and saw something they don’t like, they will scold you as well.","Very stressful rotation with malignant and occasionally hostile seniors. I guess QM SUR suits a certain personality of people and your experience varies largely between wards.

Suggestion:
Hell: LT, HBP (worse 1.5 months of your HO life)
Tolerable: EGI CRS HDU HN/PRS admission
Heaven: URO, VAS, BRS, NS, PS

LT/HBP is filled with malignant and physically hostile MOs with unrealistic expectations. Other teams are mostly nice and approachable. Just try to avoid those teams or you will be preparing for GR every Monday night till 11pm or later if your partner is on AL. You will also be spending 3 hours a day in H1 and K3 to keep trying to rebook impossible USG or CT scans because HBP requires CT before any intervention (once tried booking a CT 6 times within 24h and radiologist gave up at the end). USG might take you an hour and you will be just sitting outside waiting radiologist to be done with their cases. Hitting beans also take up most of your duty as it is guaranteed that some beans will be out throughout the day and during call. (Once witnessed a patient died because of lack of beans during resuscitation, while nurses said they dk how). Not too many OT opportunities because of the huge amount of work unless you work in chiller teams like NS URO CRS  BRS and VAS.

Call workload is manageable and usually can sleep 1-2 hours uninterruptedly. But it’s better to see the patient yourself for ward complaints, especially post op cases, as you will receive callbacks if you don’t manage properly. Nurses are competent and can give you suggestions if you aren’t sure.

Overall, QM is quite protective and it is better to call MO for more urgent ward complaints and throw the ball to them, including giving ionotropes and booking urgent scans. Otherwise, you will be scolded and possibly have to explain during their weekly census meeting at Wed 730. Learning value is okay as you don’t have deal with stupid job sheets but you have to draw lots of blood culture and write essays on ward complaints so as to protect yourself from callbacks. They like to ask you to urgently consult medical for many minor laughable stuff, i.e. troponin 30, hypertension and AF, which you have to be ready to be scolded by medical MOs, which is understandable. This department loves to practice census-based/defensive medicine as a result and you have to like to protect yourself when working in such malignant environment.",NA,"M23",NA,4,"SUR QMH"

Pros 
1.     They call on call HO for all stuff, so you can leave to HO room at 10-12am after finishing morning homework and return at 3pm for pm round, hence can be very chill, go out for lunch
2.     Post call full (can leave at 10ish after completing morning homework)
3.     MOs are friendly
4.     Compul minor OT (can be pros/ cons), but they can let you be chief surgeon for those lumps and bumps
        5. less hectic admission comparatively
        6. relatively less on9 consult to medical, and high quality consult by medical colleagues (cuz seen by dailou usu)
Cons
1.     On call have to answer all stupid things whole day (can Q1min call for change PO meds to NG tube, for panadol, for a haemolyzed RFT, set time for drug right after you left the ward)
2.     Incompetent nurse, chur bao you for non urgent PT jobsheet, but does not know how to respond in urgent/ potentially lum dong situation; does not know how to differentiate 緩急輕重, in their eyes chest physio could be more urgent than a PTX/ PE
3.     Chut Jobsheet, you have to check each patient Kardex one by one for potential hw, no hw board/ cart
4.     Need to r scan, but radiologist are reasonable; can call during on call time 
5.     3-4 day 1 call, not as rehab as described
6.     All admission bloods and beans by HO, so basically have to go out at night
7.     6am bloods by HO (yes you are 凌晨專屬血姑)
8.    They have high expectation on HO actually, 0 tolerance, easily AIRS you
        9. Have to ask ward manager for tourniquet and sign in and sign out every time you draw blood/ hit bean
        10. Nurse just keep abuse you, patient with 3 beans on hand can still ask if you could hit one more bean for them, non urgent bean and force you hit; 6 morning colonoscopy and force you to hit all 6 beans as if they are going to undergo CLN all at once
        11. Worst day if somebody CL, AL, post call, you are alone dealing with 2 wards pm round hw and one by one flipping kardex to find hw 
        12. Have to go out just to fill in sheet for transfusion
        13. Even most junior nurse can play phone, after they call you, know nothing about the case/ realize they call the wrong person/ call you for moliu stuff (HO augmentin 點較鐘架)
